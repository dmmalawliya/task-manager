# 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
## I spent 9-10 hours on the coding test

# 2. What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language?
## I chose Javascript as my language and JavaScript (ES2022/ESNext) has one highly useful addition is the .at() method for arrays and strings. It simplifies accessing elements, especially with negative indexing, and can be particularly useful for handling edge cases without manually calculating the index

---
const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
console.log(arr.at(-1)); // Output: 50

# 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
## To address a production performance issue, I would:
## - Monitor Logs: Check server and application logs for error patterns, unexpected bottlenecks, or resource usage spikes.
## - Use Profiling and Monitoring Tools: Tools like New Relic, Datadog, or APM can provide insights into latency and memory usage, helping isolate problematic code or slow endpoints.
## - Replicate in a Staging Environment: If possible, I would replicate the issue in a staging environment to safely identify the root cause.
## Yes, Iâ€™ve encountered production issues and used these methods to pinpoint and resolve bottlenecks effectively

# 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
## Additional Features:
## + Recurring Tasks: Adding the ability to set tasks to repeat daily, weekly, etc.
## + Prioritization and Sorting: Allow users to set priorities and filter or sort tasks based on importance.
## + Notifications and Reminders: Integrate reminders or email notifications for due dates.
## + Collaboration: Add a feature to assign tasks to team members and track collaboration.
## Improvements:
## * Enhanced Accessibility: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
## * Performance Optimization: Implement lazy loading and optimize database queries.
## * Theming Options: Provide more customization for users to personalize the look and feel of the app.
## Each of these improvements would enhance usability and add value for end-users.
